# Hola! 🚀 

My name is **Fahim**, your friendly neighborhood Backend Engineer, and welcome to the whimsy wonderland... otherwise known as my GitHub!

## 🎉 A Little About Me:

- 🔭 I’m currently juggling so many projects, studying, researching I might as well be a circus performer! 
- 🌱 I’m always learning... mostly from hilarious mishaps and the occasional facepalm moment!
- 🤔 I’m on a quest to find a way to add more hours to a day. Any time travelers out there?
- 💬 Ask me about the time I thought recursion was a complicated yoga move. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Send a raven, smoke signal, or just email me, that's cool too!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can write code without ~~googling~~... utilizing co-pilot! (Trust me, bro; I'm basically a wizard! 🧙‍♂️)

## Some Serious Stuff (because every funhouse needs a dull corner) 

- 🛠️ I'm proficient in `PHP`, `Laravel`, `C#`, `.NET`, `JavaScript`, and `Sarcasm`. Yes, it’s a coding language now! :D 
- 🎓 🎓 Completed my Bachelor's in Software Engineering(2018), and now I’m leveling up my education with a Master’s (2024-2026).
- 💼 With nearly 7 years of industry experience, I've mastered the art of pretending to know what I'm doing.
- 🌍 Currently exploring the exciting (and sometimes terrifying) realms of `LLM / Agentic RAG Data Harmonization /` because who doesn’t want a robot minion?
